## Details
The application is written in C# and WPF is used for the user interface.
The goal of this application was to build a little todo app for myself and also practice some of my knowledge in WPF, design patterns and some packages.

Amazing packages i used in this little project:
- <a href="https://github.com/lepoco/wpfui">WPF UI</a>
- <a href="https://github.com/CommunityToolkit/dotnet">MVVM Community Toolkit</a>
- <a href="https://www.flaticon.com/free-icons/to-do-list">To do list icon created by Freepik - Flaticon</a>
